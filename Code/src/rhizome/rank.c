Serval Low-bandwidth asychronous Rhizome Demonstrator.
Copyright (C) 2015 Serval Project Inc.

This program monitors a local Rhizome database and attempts
to synchronise it over low-bandwidth declarative transports, 
such as bluetooth name or wifi-direct service information
messages.  It is intended to give a high priority to MeshMS
converations among nearby nodes.

The design is fully asynchronous, so a call to the update_my_message()
function from time to time should be all that is required.
