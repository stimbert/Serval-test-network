I would like to express my gratitude to all the people who helped me during the project and made it a reality in the first place.

First, I would like to thank my supervisor, Paul Gardner-Stephen, for his precious help during the project, all the advices he gave me and for trusting me in this project. Thanks to him, I feel I have become a better engineer.

I would also like to thank Flinders for accepting me as an exchange to them. Thanks to them, I was able to come here in Australia and live one of the greatest experience of my life as a student.

Finally, I want to thank my home school, INSA, for giving me the possibility to study abroad.
