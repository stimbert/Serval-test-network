\chapter{Future work}

There are some work that needs to be done to complete the solution.
First, the test network should be done in real scale in Tonsley to see if it still work in the real case.

Then, the missing features should be developed and added. 
At this point we will have a real test network.

After that, improvements can be done to the solution. For instance, I think some part of the installation process could be made easier.
Another major improvement could be to replace the client\_shell by a graphical interface. A graphical interface will make the solution more instinctive to use. That was one of my wish when I started this project. I wanted to have a graphical interface for the user. However, I knew I would not have the time to create it. That's why I decided to opt for the shell-like solution.
